Financial decisions involve uncertainty, meaning they can lead to either gains or losses (Levy, 2016). The context in which these decisions occur can affect how people behave. Factors like our thought processes and mood play a role in how we make financial choices and handle risk. Music, for instance, can significantly impact our mood (Dillman Carpentier and Potter, 2007; Husain et al., 2002; Thompson et al., 2001).

People often listen to music while doing various tasks, including making financial decisions. Research indicates that background music can influence both our thinking and behavior. For instance, the tempo of music can affect how quickly customers act (North and Hargreaves, 2009), and soothing music might boost overall cognitive performance (Cockerton et al., 1997). However, background music can also overload our mental capacity, leading to decreased efficiency (Thompson et al., 2012), especially when the task and music require processing in the same way.

Specific genres and tempos can have different effects. For instance, fast-paced and loud music, including certain types of classical music, garage music, and hip hop, can impair reading comprehension (Thompson et al., 2012; Furnham and Strbac, 2002; Chou, 2010).\\

Understanding how music influences financial decisions is crucial for financial institutions, investors, and others in high-risk fields.

In this report, we analyze the factors affecting risk-taking in financial decisions and explore music-related strategies to improve decision-making and increase investment success.
